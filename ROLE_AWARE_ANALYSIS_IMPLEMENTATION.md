# Role-Aware Resume Analysis Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the AI service to provide role-specific skill gap analysis and learning recommendations based on the user's career goal from their profile.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Backend AI Service Enhancements (`backend/services/aiService.js`)

#### New Learning-Focused Prompt
- **Function**: `learningPrompt(resumeText, identifiedSkills, targetRole)`
- **Purpose**: Generates role-specific prompts that focus on actionable skill gaps
- **Features**:
  - Takes user's target role (e.g., "ML Engineer", "DevOps Engineer")
  - Identifies 3-5 missing/weak skills critical for that role
  - Provides concrete learning paths with specific resources
  - Includes realistic time estimates and priority levels

#### Role Mapping System
- **Function**: `getTargetRoleFromProfile(userProfile)`
- **Purpose**: Maps career goals from user profile to readable role names
- **Mappings**:
  - `ml-engineer` → "ML Engineer"
  - `devops-engineer` → "DevOps Engineer" 
  - `frontend-developer` → "Frontend Developer"
  - `backend-developer` → "Backend Developer"
  - `fullstack-developer` → "Full Stack Developer"
  - Default: "Software Engineer"

#### Role-Specific Fallback Analysis
- **Function**: `getRoleSpecificFallbackAnalysis(targetRole, identifiedSkills)`
- **Purpose**: Provides role-specific skill gaps when AI analysis fails
- **Examples**:
  - **ML Engineer**: TensorFlow Serving, Feature Stores, Data Drift Monitoring
  - **DevOps Engineer**: Terraform, Prometheus, Helm
  - **Frontend Developer**: TypeScript, Testing (Jest/Cypress), Performance Optimization

### 2. Enhanced Resume Analysis Flow

#### Updated Analysis Method
```javascript
// Before: Generic analysis
const analysisResult = await aiService.analyzeResume(resumeText);

// After: Role-aware analysis
const userProfile = await User.findById(userId).select('profile');
const analysisResult = await aiService.analyzeResume(resumeText, userProfile);
```

#### Improved Response Structure
```json
{
  "skillGaps": [
    {"name": "Docker & Kubernetes", "priority": "High"},
    {"name": "Advanced SQL Optimization", "priority": "Medium"}
  ],
  "learningPath": [
    {
      "title": "Docker & Kubernetes Fundamentals",
      "priority": "High", 
      "duration": "3-4 weeks",
      "resources": [
        {"title": "Kubernetes Official Tutorial", "url": "https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/"},
        {"title": "Docker Mastery Course", "url": "https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery/"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": "Highlight your strengths in Python ML but add deployment skills for ML Engineer roles."
}
```

### 3. Frontend Component Updates (`frontend/src/components/resume/ResumeAnalysisResults.jsx`)

#### Enhanced Learning Path Display
- **Grouped by Skill Gaps**: Learning paths now show which specific skill gap each step addresses
- **Role Context**: Explains why each skill gap matters for the user's target role
- **Better Resource Display**: Shows resource types (course, video, article) with appropriate icons
- **Priority Visualization**: Clear priority indicators (High, Medium, Low) with color coding

#### New Features
- **Skill Gap Context**: Each learning step shows which skill gap it addresses
- **Role Relevance**: Explains why the skill is important for the target role
- **Resource Categorization**: Different icons and labels for different resource types
- **Interactive Resources**: Clickable links with hover effects and toast notifications

### 4. Controller Integration (`backend/controllers/resumeController.js`)

#### Updated Analysis Endpoint
```javascript
// Get user profile for role-aware analysis
const userProfile = await User.findById(userId).select('profile');
const analysisResult = await aiService.analyzeResume(resumeText, userProfile);
```
