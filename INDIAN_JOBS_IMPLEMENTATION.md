# Indian Job Recommendations Implementation

## Overview
Implemented mock job recommendations with Indian context, INR salaries, and realistic job data to make the hackathon demo more relevant for Indian users and judges.

- ‚úÖ **After:** Indian companies with INR salaries (‚Çπ12L - ‚Çπ20L per year)
- ‚úÖ **After:** Indian tech hubs and realistic job market data
- ‚úÖ **After:** Fast, reliable mock data for demo

  userProfile?.profile || { careerGoal: 'fullstack-developer', experience: 'intermediate', interests: [] },
  analysisResult
);
```

### 4. New API Endpoints
**File:** `backend/routes/resume.js`
