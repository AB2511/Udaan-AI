# Job-Specific AI Mock Interview Questions Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented job-specific AI mock interview questions that adapt based on the candidate's career goal and resume content. The system now generates targeted questions for different career paths including DevOps Engineer, Frontend Developer, Data Scientist, and Backend Developer.

## âœ… Implementation Summary

### 1. Backend AI Service Updates (`backend/services/aiService.js`)

**Enhanced Prompt Generation:**
- Updated `generateInterviewQuestions()` method to accept `careerGoal` parameter
- Implemented job-specific prompt rules for different career paths:
  - **DevOps Engineer**: CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, monitoring
  - **Frontend Developer**: React, JavaScript, performance optimization, UI/UX
  - **Data Scientist**: Python, Pandas, ML models, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, system design for ML
  - **Backend Developer**: APIs, databases, system design, server architecture
  - **Fullstack Developer**: Both frontend and backend technologies

**New Prompt Format:**
```javascript
const prompt = `You are an AI interviewer for Indian students. Based on the candidate's resume and career preference, generate ${questionCount} job-specific interview questions.

RULES:
- If careerGoal = 'DevOps Engineer', ask about CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, and monitoring.
- If careerGoal = 'Frontend Developer', ask about React, JavaScript, performance optimization, and UI/UX.
- If careerGoal = 'Data Scientist', ask about Python, Pandas, ML models, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, system design for ML.
...

Return as JSON only:
{
  "questions": [
    {"q": "Explain how you implemented Blue/Green deployments in your CI/CD pipeline.", "type": "technical", "tip": "Focus on the deployment strategy and benefits"}
  ]
}`;
```

**Career-Specific Fallback Questions:**
- Added `getCareerSpecificFallbackQuestions()` method
- Provides 5 tailored questions for each career path when AI service fails
- Ensures consistent job-relevant questions even during service outages

### 2. Interview Question Service Updates (`backend/services/InterviewQuestionService.js`)

**Enhanced Question Generation:**
- Updated `generateQuestions()` to accept `options` parameter with `careerGoal`
- Passes career goal to AI service for targeted question generation
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing API calls

```javascript
async generateQuestions(resumeContent = '', questionCount = 5, options = {}) {
  const { careerGoal, role = 'software-developer' } = options;
  
  const questions = await this.aiService.generateInterviewQuestions(
    resumeContent,
    role,
    Math.min(Math.max(questionCount, 3), 5),
    careerGoal
  );
}
```

### 3. Interview Controller Updates (`backend/controllers/interviewController.js`)

**Career Goal Integration:**
- Updated `generateInterviewQuestions()` endpoint to accept `careerGoal` parameter
- Retrieves user profile career goal as fallback when not provided
- Updated `startInterview()` to pass career goal from user profile or request body

**Enhanced API Endpoints:**
```javascript
// POST /api/interviews/generate-questions
const { resumeContent = '', questionCount = 5, careerGoal = null } = req.body;
const user = await User.findById(req.user._id).select('profile');
const finalCareerGoal = careerGoal || user?.profile?.careerGoal;

// POST /api/interviews/start  
const { careerGoal = null } = req.body;
// Uses careerGoal from request or user profile
```

### 4. Frontend Interview Setup Updates (`frontend/src/components/interview/InterviewSetup.jsx`)

**User Profile Integration:**
- Added `useAuth` hook to access user profile data
- Automatically passes `careerGoal` from user profile when starting interviews
- Maintains existing UI while enhancing backend functionality

```javascript
import { useAuth } from '../../context/AuthContext';

const { user } = useAuth();

const response = await interviewService.startInterview({
  sessionType: selectedType,
  role: selectedRole,
  experienceLevel: selectedExperience,
  difficulty: 'medium',
  careerGoal: user?.profile?.careerGoal // Pass career goal from user profile
});
```

### 5. Interview Service Updates (`frontend/src/services/interviewService.js`)

**Career Goal Parameter Handling:**
- Enhanced `startInterview()` to accept and pass `careerGoal` parameter
- Maintains existing validation while adding new functionality
- Ensures career goal is properly transmitted to backend

```javascript
config = builder.build();

// Add careerGoal if provided (not part of builder validation)
if (interviewConfig.careerGoal) {
  config.careerGoal = interviewConfig.careerGoal;
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Job-Specific Question Generation**
- Questions automatically adapt based on career goals
- DevOps questions focus on infrastructure, CI/CD, and cloud technologies
- Frontend questions emphasize React, performance, and UI/UX
- Data Science questions cover ML models, Python libraries, and data analysis
- Backend questions address APIs, databases, and system architecture

### 2. **Intelligent Fallback System**
- Career-specific fallback questions when AI service is unavailable
- Ensures consistent quality regardless of AI service status
- Maintains job relevance even during service outages

### 3. **Seamless User Experience**
- Automatically uses career goal from user profile
- No additional UI changes required for users
- Backward compatible with existing interview flows

### 4. **Flexible API Design**
- Supports both explicit career goal parameter and profile-based detection
- Maintains existing API compatibility
- Allows for future enhancements and customizations

## ðŸ“Š Example Question Variations

### DevOps Engineer Questions:
1. "Explain how you would implement a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices architecture."
2. "How would you monitor and troubleshoot a Kubernetes cluster in production?"
3. "Describe your experience with Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform."

### Frontend Developer Questions:
1. "How do you optimize React application performance?"
2. "Explain the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React."
3. "How do you ensure cross-browser compatibility in your applications?"

### Data Scientist Questions:
1. "How do you handle missing data in your machine learning models?"
2. "Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning."
3. "How do you evaluate the performance of a classification model?"

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Response Format:
The AI service now returns questions in the enhanced format:
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "q": "How would you implement Blue/Green deployments in your CI/CD pipeline?",
      "type": "technical",
      "tip": "Focus on the deployment strategy and benefits"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error Handling:
- Graceful fallback to career-specific questions when AI fails
- Maintains service availability during AI service outages
- Provides meaningful error messages for debugging

### Performance Considerations:
- Minimal additional overhead for career goal processing
